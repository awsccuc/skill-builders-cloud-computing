# Cloud Computing

In this folder you'll find assets associated to "[Infrastructure for the Rest of Us](https://s12d.com/infra-camp)", a "Cloud Club Camp" where you'll learn the basics of Infrastructure on AWS.

What's "Camp"? It's a workshop, only better! With a trained facilitator, work through the modules in the workshop [here](https://s12d.com/infra-camp). They include quizzes and challenges and the ability to earn badges on completion. While this experience is normally available for AWS Cloud Clubs, reach out to awscloudclubs@amazon.com if you'd like to run this Camp in a non-Cloud Club environment.
